# ❌⭕ Tic-Tac-Toe Game 

A simple and interactive **Tic-Tac-Toe game** built using
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Two players take turns marking
X and O on the grid, and the game detects the winner or draw automatically.

This project helped me practice game logic, DOM manipulation,
and conditional programming in JavaScript.
